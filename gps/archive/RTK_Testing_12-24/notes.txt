Possible RTCM / Wiring setup for moving base and static base with moving rover.

Static base will transfer RTCM3 over USB serial then the network to the moving base.
Moving base will transfer RTCM3 over UART interface to the moving rover.

Moving base and moving rover will be connected via USB for configurations / getting positions.

If cannot get the relposned then use the previous absolute heading 1 visualizer code.
Need to reduce Hz??

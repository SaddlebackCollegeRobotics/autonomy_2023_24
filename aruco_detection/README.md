All code for autonomous rover systems. Current projects:

## Aruco Tag Detection
  **camera calibration tool** - tool for calibrating any camera for use with pose estimation. Allows user to select a camera to use, then after input 
                                input photos of checkerboard are taken, generates camera matrix and distortion coefficients. 
                                
  **tag detect** - example code running tag detection. Code uses pose estimation for accurate distance estimates. Output given as terminal lines, see example                      photo
